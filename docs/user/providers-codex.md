# Codex

This guide is for people who want to use more than one Codex account in T3 Code. For Claude, see
[Claude](./providers-claude.md). For first-time setup, see [Install T3 Code](./install.md).

Common reasons:

- use a work account for work projects
- use a personal account for personal projects
- switch to another account when one account hits limits
- keep one shared Codex history instead of maintaining two separate Codex setups

## I Only Use One Codex Account

Use the default provider.

In Settings, your Codex provider can stay like this:

```text
Display name: Codex
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

Log in with Codex normally:

```bash
codex login
```

## Send feedback to OpenAI

In an existing Codex thread, send `/feedback` or `/feedback` followed by a description of the
issue. T3 Code uploads the thread and Codex logs to OpenAI and shows a thread ID that you can copy
and share with OpenAI employees.

## Approve access to other apps

When a Codex tool needs access to an app such as Safari, T3 Code shows the app name and asks for
approval. You can approve, decline, or cancel the request from the desktop app, web app, or mobile
app. Some tools also offer approval for the current session or permanent approval.

## Usage-limit resets

For ChatGPT-backed Codex accounts, CPH Code reads provider-reported allowances through Codex's
app-server rate-limit RPC. The Usage page shows every reported window, including five-hour, weekly,
and named limit buckets. The provider selector includes the same meters, and the composer shows a
compact shortcut to the active account's limits. CPH Code uses each window's reported duration
instead of assuming that the protocol's primary and secondary positions always mean the same thing.

When Codex reports that the account has hit its usage limit, CPH Code gives it the same
explicit-reset handling as Claude: a shared countdown, an error bar on every thread using that
account, **Until usage resets** in the Snooze menu, and **Send after usage resets** for idle
existing threads. Exhaustion is recognized only from Codex's explicit usage-limit turn error, never
inferred from rolling-window telemetry alone; once recognized, the machine-readable window reset
from the rate-limit RPC refines the countdown, with the reset time printed in the error as a
fallback.

OpenAI enforces the limit when a turn starts, so Codex work that was already running keeps going
and finishes normally even while the account is exhausted. Only new turns fail, and a completed
in-flight turn does not clear the countdown. The limited state clears when the reset passes, when
the exhausted window is reported back under 100%, or when purchased credits make the account
usable again.

## I Want Work And Personal Codex Accounts

Use one real Codex home and one shadow home.

Recommended setup:

```text
~/.codex      shared Codex home
~/.codex_p    second account auth
```

The idea is:

- both accounts can see the same T3/Codex sessions
- each account keeps its own login
- existing threads can continue with either account

### Set Up The First Account

Log in normally:

```bash
codex login
```

This is the account used by `~/.codex`.

In T3 Code Settings, name it something obvious:

```text
Display name: Codex Work
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

### Set Up The Second Account

Log in with a separate Codex home:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex_p
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_p codex login
```

In T3 Code Settings, add another Codex provider:

```text
Display name: Codex Personal
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

The important part is that both providers use the same `CODEX_HOME path`, but only the second one
has a `Shadow home path`.

## Which Account Am I Using?

Open Settings and look at the provider row.

T3 Code shows the authenticated email for providers that report one. Emails are blurred by default;
click the blurred email to reveal it.

Use display names and accent colors to make accounts easy to tell apart in the model picker.

## I Need A Different API Key Or Endpoint

Use the provider's Environment variables section in Settings.

This is useful when a Codex-compatible setup needs account-specific variables. Add the variables to
the provider instance that should receive them, and mark API keys or tokens as sensitive. Sensitive
values are stored as server secrets and are not sent back to the app after saving.

## Can I Switch Accounts In An Existing Thread?

Yes, when both Codex providers share the same `CODEX_HOME path`.

For example:

```text
Codex Work      CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Codex Personal  CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex, Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

Those two providers are considered compatible for continuation, so the locked model picker can show
both.

If you add a third Codex provider with a completely different `CODEX_HOME path`, T3 Code treats it
as a different workspace. It will not be offered for existing threads created under `~/.codex`.

## If Both Accounts Look The Same

If two Codex providers show the same account or the same unexpected model list:

1. Check the email in Settings.
2. Refresh provider status.
3. Confirm the second provider has `Shadow home path` set.
4. Confirm the shadow directory has its own `auth.json`.
5. If you copied `~/.codex` into the shadow directory, remove everything except `auth.json`.

Example cleanup:

```bash
find ~/.codex_p -mindepth 1 ! -name auth.json -exec rm -rf {} +
```

## When To Use A Separate CODEX_HOME

Use a totally separate `CODEX_HOME path` only when you want a separate Codex workspace.

That means separate sessions and less account switching inside old threads. Most dual-account users
should use the shared-home plus shadow-home setup instead.
